Followed a tutorial from Traversy media and customized the styling a bit. I was exposed to srElement and used some regex to remove the hyphens from the audio files to display the song title properly. I also had to figure out why a div being hidden from the front-most div was blocking the navigations click events. I solved this by taking the hidden div and setting it to a negative z-index.
